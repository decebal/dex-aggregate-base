              On Solana, SUI, Aptos, and SEI, DEX aggregators like Jupiter and Umi.ag are building efficient,

                In the rapidly shifting landscape of decentralized finance, DEX aggregators are quietly orchestrating a
                transformation across blockchain ecosystems. From Solana’s high-speed infrastructure to emerging
                platforms like SUI and Aptos, and even Base, a Layer 2 solution by Coinbase, these aggregators are
                redefining how liquidity flows and trades are executed. Their promise? To bring efficiency,
                transparency, and accessibility to a fragmented market.
